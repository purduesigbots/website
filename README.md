# Our Website

Built with hugo with theme somrat. Because hugo is so confusing I had to copy somrat over to make the changes. Super fun.

## How to run
To build, run `hugo --gc --minify` in the root directory. 
To run a local server for development, run `hugo server --gc --minify` in the root directory.
