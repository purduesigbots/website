Purdue University's ACM SIGBots competed in the VEX Robotics World Championship, presented by the Northrop Grumman Foundation, with a total of 114 university teams in attendance at the event in Dallas, TX.

The event was split into two divisions, both seeing representation from Purdue SIGBots with BLRS in the Spirit Division and a second Purdue team, BLRS2, in the Innovate Division.

During the qualifications both teams performed well, with BLRS being 5th in their division with a record of 8-1-0 and BLRS2 being 7th in their division with a record of 8-0-1. 

In the elimination rounds, BLRS was able to make it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by South Dakota State University's team, JACKS. 

The BLRS2 went on to win the grand finals and defeated CalPoly SLO's team, CPSLO, to become World Champions along with winning the design award, the second highest award for the design, engineering and software in the competition.

They were recognized for hosting the largest WIKI for resources in the VEX community, running a coding help hotline for elementary and middle school teams in Indiana, and volunteering at a dozen high school robotics events in Indiana, as well as hosting two high school competitions at Purdue University West Lafayette and the largest college competition in the United States, apart from the national competition.
